# NKOS bibliography

In this bibliography we cover mostly workshop content from the past NKOS workshops.

All paper presentations from the NKOS workshops are stored in single bibtex files (`ECDL[year].bib`, `TPDL[year].bib`). Introduction presentations are not covered in the bib files. See folder `bibtex`.
