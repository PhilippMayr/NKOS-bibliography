abstract = {Traditionally, research on knowledge organization systems (KOS) and information retrieval discussed the relative advantages or disadvantages of using controlled vocabularies versus free-text or intellectual indexing versus automatic indexing methods for indexing and search. Experiments and case studies variously showed the superiority of either approach without reaching a final conclusion on this seemingly basic question. As full-text indexing has become more possible and now prevalent, the discussion of the relative merits of KOS – not only as substitute but in combination with full-text – was not settled but continued with new challenges. With the advent of the Semantic Web, KOS (now appearing as ontologies) became important tools in new information retrieval applications and were pushed once again to the research forefront. With different disciplines working in the field, the terminology around KOS has become more and more ambiguous up to the point that tracing research in the literature is difficult – ironically something that traditional KOS have always tried to mitigate. This paper summarizes recent discussions of the impact of KOS on information retrieval and attempts to show and unify different research strands from library science research on subject indexing, information retrieval and the Semantic Web. Whereas earlier impact studies on retrieval resulted in clearly measurable outcomes (for example changes in precision / recall), recent use of KOS in Semantic Web applications or other information systems has switched from pure search scenarios to exploration (browse) and contextualization, for which clear (and calculable) evaluation or quality standards and benchmarks do not exist.},

abstract = {Workplace searching is often context-specific and targets a 'right answer' within some domain-specific aspect of the search topic. We have developed the semantic component (SC) model that allows searchers to specify a search within context-specific aspects of the main topic of documents. The goal of our study was to gain insight into how family practice physicians at sundhed.dk, a national healthcare portal in Denmark, applied the SC model to formulate queries to solve work-related search tasks. The results showed that doctors used the model purposively when choosing search facets and search concepts. They were relatively consistent in their use. The findings provide promising evidence of the model's potential usefulness},

@inproceedings{ElinK.Jacob2011,
abstract = {Folksonomy research has not developed a standardized toolbox of analytical strategies, generally relying on descriptive methods to investigate the structure, composition and evolution of tagging vocabularies. Rank order (RO) based on tag frequency has been used to study various aspects of folksonomies: how well tags categorize resources (Brooks {\&} Montanez, 2005; Kipp {\&} Campbell, 2006) and identification of tagging patterns (Munk {\&} Mork, 2007), and trends in user interest (Ding et al., 2009). However, results of simple RO may be misleading. For example, a tag whose frequency of use increases across two years may actually account for a smaller percentage of total tags assigned in the second year, or a tag whose rank declines across two years may actually account for a greater percentage of tags in the second year than the first. This research addresses the validity of assumptions underlying RO analysis by investigating how it correlates with both frequency and percentage of tag frequency across various time periods. Effects of RO by frequency of tag occurrence, taggers and URLs were investigated in a targeted sample collected from delicious.com for 2004 through 2007. After removing all singleton tags, the dataset consisted of 7,863 URLs to which 1,804,379 tags had been assigned by 186,075 taggers. Because of the non-normal distribution of tag frequency data, non-parametric statistical tests were used to calculate correlations. Results of the analysis found that the correlation between RO and frequency was high, but that correlation between RO and percentage of actual use was problematic.},
