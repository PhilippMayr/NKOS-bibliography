\begin{abstract}		
In this paper we analyze a major part of the research output of the Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) community in the period 2000 to 2015. We focus on the paper output presented at the European NKOS workshops in the last 15 years. Our open dataset, the "NKOS bibliography", includes 14 workshop agendas (ECDL 2000-2010, TPDL 2011-2015) and 4 special issues on NKOS (2001, 2004, 2006 and 2015) which cover 171 papers with 218 distinct authors in total. A focus of the analysis is the visualization of co-authorship networks in this interdisciplinary field. We used standard network analytic measures like degree and betweenness centrality to describe the co-authorship distribution in our NKOS dataset. %todo add some more facts

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

The European NKOS network has held a long-running series of annual workshops at the European Conference on Digital Libraries (ECDL), latterly reformed as the International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL). 
Typically, recent advances of KOS have been reported at the NKOS workshops, e.g. including the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) W3C standard, the ISO 25964 thesauri standard, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), Linked Data applications, KOS-based recommender systems, KOS mapping techniques, KOS registries and metadata, social tagging, user-centred issues, and many other topics. A comprehensive and well cited review article on KOS and NKOS topics was published in 2004 \cite{Zeng2004}. Special issues on Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) have been published in Journal of Digital Information in 2001 and 2004, in New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia in 2006 and in the International Journal of Digital Libraries in 2015 \cite{Mayr2016}. 

The motivation of this paper is to analyse the research output of the NKOS community. We are focusing on the informal part of this output, the paper presentations given at the past NKOS workshops (the first European NKOS workshop in 2000 to the 14th European NKOS workshop in 2015). The specialty of this research output is that these research papers typically are not published in journals or conference proceedings. These papers appear just as oral presentations at the workshop and are documented on the website. To our knowledge nobody has done an analysis on this part of the NKOS research output before. 



\section{NKOS workshop bibliography}\label{dataset}

For our analysis we have compiled an open dataset the "NKOS bibliography"\footnote{The NKOS workshop bibliography is maintained in the following github repository: https://github.com/PhilippMayr/NKOS-bibliography} which includes 14 workshop programs with all presented papers at ECDL 2000, ECDL 2003-2010 and TPDL 2011-2015 (see Table 1). We added papers from 4 special issues on NKOS which have been published in the same period (see Table 2). 

In a first step we have extracted all paper titles presented at the NKOS workshop websites. We added papers from the special issues. These papers are the only formal publications in our analysis.  In the end we manually disambiguated author names of all papers.

Our dataset covers 171 papers in total with altogether 218 distinct author names. Table 1 provides an overview of all workshop papers.

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}

In order to analyze the collaboration in the community of NKOS workshops we built a network of all authors in this community and computed the centrality of each author. For this purpose we utilized some standard centrality measures in Pajek\footnote{A program for analysis and visualization of very large networks(http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/)}. The network is composed of pairs of author names. Each pair means that two authors cooperated for writing a paper. If we have n papers and the paper \textit{i} has $m_i$ authors, the number of pairs are %todo Fakhri as formular
\begin{equation}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{m_i(m_i-1)}{2}\end{equation}
These pairs built the network for our analysis in Pajek. To avoid repetition of pairs, we gave weight to pairs and it is equal to the number of cooperations of two authors in different papers. 
Two often used centrality measures of authors are degree and betweenness. Degree is the number of nodes that a focal node is connected to, and measures the involvement of the node in the network \cite{Opsahl2010}. In our authorship-network it specifies the sum of co-authors for all papers that each author has written. Betweenness assesses the degree to which a node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes, and is able to funnel the flow in the network \cite{Opsahl2010}. In the authorship-network the author with high betweenness has a large influence on the transfer of information. 


\section{Results}\label{results}

Figure \ref{fig:wholenet} demonstrates a general view of the network. In this view each author has at least one co-author. This networks contains 31 components. From the network illustrated in this figure we selected the largest component that is represented in Figure \ref{fig:largestComponent}. 68 authors (31\% of all authors) are in this component.

	\caption{The whole network of authors in the NKOS community}

	\vspace{-0.5em}
\end{figure}
To show the quantity of collaboration in the community we measured the degree centrality for each author. Figure \ref{fig:degreePercentage} shows the percentage of authors with different degrees. In this Figure we see that 15\% (with degree=0) of authors had no co-authorship with others and 53\% of them had just a maximum of 6 cooperations with other authors. 32\% had at least 8 co-authors for all their papers.

Figure \ref{fig:degree16} shows the authors with most degree (more than 16) in the network.

\end{figure}


To detect the influence of authors on information exchange we calculated the betweenness centrality of authors. Figure \ref{fig:betweenness} shows the authors with the highest betweenness (more than 0.001).

To detect the influence of authors on information exchange we calculated the betweenness centrality of authors. Figure \ref{fig:betweenness} indicates the authors with most betweenness (more than 0.001). comparing betweenness with degree we can see, the ranking of authors has changed in betweenness. Some authors despite their high cooperation with other authors, have lower ranking in betweenness comparison to others with lower degree.

\section{Conclusion}\label{concl}
In this paper we analyzed the collaborative working of authors and their connectivity to each other. The results shows most active authors in this community who had a important roles to exchange information and connect researchers to each other. We saw the largest component in this network that one third of author belong to it. It shows that NKOS workshops were pretty success to link researcher together.
